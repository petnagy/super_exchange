# super_exchange
It is a demo applicatio

I have user Fixer.io service to calculate the exchange rates.
The API key was in a property file and not included in the repository.
If you want to test my project, you can register a free account on Fixer.io.
And you have to add this API key to your gradle.properties file.

FixerIoApi = "$YOUR_API_KEY"
